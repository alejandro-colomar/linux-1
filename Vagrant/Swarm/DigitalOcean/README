If you are using Linux then open a terminal and execute the following commands:
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secobau/linux/master/Vagrant/Swarm/DigitalOcean/setup.swarm0
  source setup.swarm0
  
These commands will start a Docker swarm with the services specified in the file stack0.yml

If you want to increase the swarm and deploy more replicas as specified in the file stack1.yml then you need to run the following commands:
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secobau/linux/master/Vagrant/Swarm/DigitalOcean/setup.swarm1
  source setup.swarm1

If you want to increase the swarm and deploy more replicas as specified in the file stack2.yml then you need to run the following commands:
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secobau/linux/master/Vagrant/Swarm/DigitalOcean/setup.swarm2
  source setup.swarm2
