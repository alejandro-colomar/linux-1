This project is to run a MultiCluster environment.

There are two folders: dc0 and dc1 for the two cloned enviroments.

You can configure the location and name of the environment in the file setup.dc that is located in each folder.

To run the first environment:
  cd dc0
  source ../setup.dc

To run the second environment:
  cd dc1
  source ../setup.dc

These commands will start a Docker swarm with the services specified in the file stack0.yml

If you want to increase the swarm and deploy more replicas as specified in the file stack1.yml then you need to uncomment the following line in the file setup.dc: 
  source ../setup.swarm1

If you want to increase the swarm and deploy more replicas as specified in the file stack2.yml then you need to uncomment the following line in the file setup.dc: 
  source ../setup.swarm2
